// A surface-shaped content panel. KWin Glass owns the visual glass finish.
//
// This exists beside LiquidGlassSurface rather than replacing it, and the
// difference is where the paint lives. LiquidGlassSurface is a Rectangle, so
// its radius, its colour and its border belong to whoever instantiates it -- a
// consumer binding outranks an internal one. That is harmless while corners are
// circular, because fill and outline are both Rectangle properties then. It
// stops being harmless the moment the corner becomes a superellipse: no
// Rectangle.radius draws one, so the shape has to become a mask, and the mask
// has to cover the fill it is shaping. Suspended from a Rectangle the mask
// cannot win that contest -- the very binding it needs to survive is the one
// the host is entitled to overwrite.
//
// Here the host sets radius on an Item that paints nothing, the fill sits in a
// child, and the only reader of radius is the mask. Nothing competes.
