# Verify this Quickshell configuration

1. Launch the real shell surface with `quickshell --path shell --no-color` (run from the repository root), redirecting output to a temporary log. Use `timeout` for a short startup observation or a background process for interaction.
2. Confirm the log reaches `Configuration Loaded`, then drive the changed dock flow using currently open applications or by opening/closing an application.
3. Inspect the captured log for QML errors, `IconImage`/source warnings, and the relevant `[DockModel]`, `[DockIcon]`, or `[DockContainer]` messages.
4. Stop only the verification instance after capture. Do not use a broad `pkill` because the user may have another Quickshell configuration running.
5. Report pre-existing warnings separately from warnings caused by the change.

GUI screenshots may fail through Spectacle when the session does not grant screenshot capture; runtime logs are the fallback evidence.
