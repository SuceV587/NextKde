// performs the window action and is consumed so it never reaches the
// application's own buttons underneath, and motion is consumed so those buttons
// are not hovered either -- a panel that covered the controls but let the
// pointer through would have them light up around its edge.
//
// It is also where the adjust gesture lives: a right press on a panel starts an
// adjust session, and while one is running the presses, motion, wheel and keys
// that the session needs are taken here before anything else can see them.
//
// This filter is installed at InputFilterOrder::Decoration, and KWin installs
// its own DecorationEventFilter at the same weight. A later install at equal
// weight runs first (InputRedirection::installInputEventFilter inserts by
// std::lower_bound over ascending weight), so this one sees these events before
// the decoration does and returning true swallows them for good.
