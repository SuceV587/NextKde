# Foundation

Portable Qt Quick foundations for standalone applications. The components in
this directory are built as the static `Kos.Ui` QML module and must not import
Quickshell, KWin, or Wayland-specific APIs.

The module provides the application window, semantic palette and material
surfaces, cards, empty states, navigation controls, rounded buttons, switch,
slider, segmented control, text field, and the common application settings
dialog. KDE compositor integration remains in `apps/common`; when native blur
is unavailable these portable QML surfaces automatically use a high-opacity
fallback.
