// iPadOS-flavoured lock screen skin.
//
// This file is loaded by kscreenlocker_greet -- not by Quickshell -- so the
// only things available to it are plain QtQuick plus the objects the greeter
// injects: `authenticator` (the PAM conversation), `wallpaper` (the Plasma
// wallpaper item), `config`, and the kscreenlocker_* globals. Nothing from
// Kos.Ui can be imported here.
//
// The greeter looks for three magic members on this root object:
//
//   property bool viewVisible
//       True while the greeter is showing the view, false while it has
//       blanked it. The greeter owns this property -- upstream's theme only
//       ever reads it -- so this theme reads it too and never writes it.
//   signal clearPassword()
//       Asks the greeter to forget a pending secret.
//   signal notificationRepeated()
//       Signals that the greeter sent the same message twice.
//
// `notification` is not required by the greeter; it is kept because that is
// where a theme is expected to accumulate PAM messages before showing them.

    // `org.kde.plasma.private.sessions`, and an import that fails to resolve
    // inside the greeter takes down the whole file that declared it. Behind a

    // only way back into the session, keeps working either way.
