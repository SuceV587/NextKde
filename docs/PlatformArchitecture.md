# Platform service architecture

`kos-platform` is the user-session adapter boundary. It is one C++20/Qt 6
process started by `kos-platform.service`; its internal modules are grouped by
capability (`applications`, `kwin`, `clipboard`, `files`, `network`, `audio`, `bluetooth`,
`display`, `session`, `theme`, `screenshot`, and `shortcuts`). They are not
separate helper executables.

## Runtime boundaries

```text
Quickshell ── JSONL ──► $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kos-platform.sock
Go data service ───────► platform operations when needed
kos-platform ── D-Bus ─► KWin / KDE services
kos-platform ── argv ───► nmcli, wpctl, bluetoothctl, loginctl, gio, etc.
```

The KWin script is installed as data and loaded by the daemon. Its private
session-D-Bus object is `org.kos.Platform` at `/Platform`; Shell never calls
that object directly. KWin effects under `kwin/` remain separate
`.so` targets because KWin discovers each plugin by ID.
`kwin/kos-decoration` is a KDecoration3 plugin rather
than an effect: it installs to the `org.kde.kdecoration3` plugin directory.
`kosctl install` installs it with the effects and never writes the selection:
choosing it is the user's, through `[org.kde.kdecoration2] library` in
`kwinrc` (System Settings ▸ Window Decorations). The bridge effect reads that
same key, so the window buttons exist exactly while this decoration is
selected — including on client-side decorated windows, which get no panel with
any other decoration selected.

It draws a title bar and a caption and stops there: no buttons (the kos-bridge
effect draws the panel over them instead), no glass, and no shape of its own.
In particular it does not call
`KDecoration3::Decoration::setBorderRadius()`. That call is how KWin clips a
window — the client's own opaque content included — which means making it
*replaces* whatever shape the window had before this decoration was selected:
Breeze keeps its corner rounding and its outline in user settings
(`~/.config/breezerc`, `[Common] RoundedCorners` / `OutlineEnabled`), and a
decoration that paints neither has no business overriding them. The title bar
is painted square for the same reason: a corner drawn inside it cannot know
the shape the window actually ends up with, so any radius there disagrees with
KWin's clip along the diagonal.

The frosted material is likewise not painted here — the title bar is an opaque
fill in the window's own colour, and no blur region is published. It has to be
opaque: the kos-bridge effect reads that strip back to choose the button
panel's tint, so a translucent bar over the compositor's blur would tint the
panel from a blend of the bar and whatever sits behind the window.

Glass deliberately has two rendering paths. A surface that declares a shape
receives the full liquid/soft material; every other window receives only the
blur result, Quickshell surfaces that declare nothing included -- which is how
the Material form reads as frost. That path does not refract, tint, highlight or
add noise, and the SDF mask it is cut with takes KWin's own window radius rather
than a declared shape: client and decoration remain responsible for their own
shape. The vendored effect also subtracts opaque client content, which prevents
transparent layer-shell windows from blurring unused space and avoids painting
behind opaque application content.

## Per-surface glass shape protocol

`ext-background-effect` carries only a union of integer rectangles. There is no
radius or corner field, so the region can say which background pixels are
captured but not what shape the material drawn over them has. The radius would
have to be guessed from the region's own outline, and that guess describes at
best one circular card on one surface: it cannot express the superellipse, and
it cannot hold two shapes in one surface (the Dock pill and its Home Indicator,
or several control-centre cards). Glass no longer guesses. The shape is declared
explicitly over `kos-surface-shape-v1`, and the region-driven path that remains
for a surface declaring nothing feeds the SDF KWin's own window radius -- the
same value the ordinary-window path has always used -- so there is one source of
rounding rather than one source plus an inference.

`shell/native/surface-shape/kos-surface-shape-v1.xml` is a project-local protocol that carries the
missing fields. It is deliberately not a Quickshell fork:

```text
kos_surface_shape_manager_v1.get_shape(wl_surface) ──► kos_surface_shape_v1
    set_geometry(x, y, width, height)   surface-local logical units
    set_corner(radius, exponent)        both wl_fixed
    set_enabled(enabled)
    set_role(role)                      v2 compatibility no-op
    set_scrim(enabled, tint, cap, decay) protocol v3; tint 0=black, 1=white
    set_blur(enabled, level)             v4; final blur level 1...15
    set_capture_geometry(x, y, w, h)     v5; fixed capture bounds
    set_material_opacity(opacity)        v6; whole material opacity
    set_reveal(enabled, opened, duration, serial) v7; compositor reveal
    reveal_finished(opened, serial)      v7 event
```

The manager and shape interfaces are version 7; each shape uses the negotiated
manager version. `set_role` remains solely to
keep the opcode layout compatible with v2 clients; KOS does not publish roles.
`set_scrim` is sent only when the bound compositor advertises v3, so clients
remain safe with an older effect. `cap` is the maximum scrim opacity, clamped
to `0...1`. `decay` is clamped to `0...4` and picks the mode: at or below `1` it
scales the backdrop-derived ramp; above `1` it selects fixed mode, where `cap`
is the exact opacity and the backdrop luminance is never sampled; above `2` it
selects the fixed neutral graphite material instead of the black/white tint;
above `3` selects the fixed warm pearl material.
Each above-`1` encoding lets a compositor that predates that mode clamp the
request back to the one below it instead of failing.

One surface may hold any number of shapes, which is what keeps the multi-card
case open. Three pieces implement it and all three build from this repository:

| Piece | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol | `shell/native/surface-shape/kos-surface-shape-v1.xml` | Shared wire definition. |
| Client | `shell/native/surface-shape/` | QML native module `Kos.SurfaceShape`. Its `SurfaceShape` type attaches to any `QQuickItem`, publishes the item's `mapRectToScene()` rectangle, and walks the ancestor chain so a parent move is not missed. |
| Server | `kwin/glass-effect/src/surfaceshapemanager.{h,cpp}` | Creates the global inside the glass effect and keeps per-surface state. |

`LiquidGlassPanel` owns a declaration per panel, so
each popup's shape objects are independent. Where a surface declares shapes the
effect drops the region-derived content geometry and draws one shape per card
instead, re-uploading `box`, `cornerRadius` and `cornerExponent` between draws --
`cornerRadius` and `cornerExponent` straight from `set_corner()`, so the SDF
outline is the client's rather than the compositor's; the noise pass is per shape
as well. Blur Region still decides which background pixels are captured.

A surface that declares nothing is unglassed, not unshaped. Its material keeps
following the region: the effect adopts the region's own geometry as the material
shape and floors its blur strength at level 6, because a region-only surface has
no `set_blur` level to carry and would otherwise render at the single-pass
`BlurStrength` kwinrc asks for -- a tinted plate rather than frost. The floor is
gated on the surface being a KOS surface (`isQuickshellSurface`: a Quickshell
window, or one that declared a shape), so an ordinary blurred window with a
region and no shape still follows kwinrc exactly. The desk clock's gear is the
case it exists for.

The swap is all-or-nothing, and it is committed only once at least one shape
became geometry to draw. A shape that is off-screen, clipped away or zero-sized
must not take the surface's whole glass with it: the region geometry it was meant
to refine is then the only thing left, and dropping it leaves the window
unblurred until something else damages those pixels -- "the middle of the Dock
has no glass" rather than a missing shape. The same rule covers a declared set
that does not describe this surface's region. Alignment between the two is a
single translation, so a set that is a strict subset or superset of the region
slides every shape by the difference -- a card panel whose overlay sheet was left
out of the union moved its glass 238px. When the declared bounds do not match the
region's, the draws are dropped and the region supplies both geometry and blur
level, which is what a region shaped by one of its own cards (the desk clock's
gear) relies on.

Three properties of this arrangement are load-bearing:

- **Its build is not a plugin build.** The client module links Qt and
  wayland-client only -- no KWin. It needs `enable_language(C)` in its own
  `CMakeLists.txt`, because `project(KOS ... LANGUAGES CXX)` makes CMake accept
  the `wayland-…-protocol.c` that `ecm_add_wayland_client_protocol()` appends and
  then silently never compile it: the module still links, and fails only at
  `dlopen` with `undefined symbol: kos_surface_shape_v1_interface`.
- **It must reach Qt's import path, not `KDE_INSTALL_QMLDIR`.** The latter
  resolves to `<prefix>/lib/qml`, which is not a directory Qt searches;
  `QT_INSTALL_QML` is `<prefix>/lib/qt6/qml` and holds every module on the
  system. The install target uses the latter, which is why the source-tree run
  needs `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` (set by `kosctl dev`) and the installed run does not.
- **The global is owned by the effect, so its teardown is a contract.** Disabling
  the glass effect destroys the manager. `wl_global_destroy` removes the global
  but leaves existing bound resources alive, so their user data must be cleared
  explicitly before the manager is freed. The
  server must *detach* client-owned shape resources rather than destroy them:
  destroying one drops its id from the client's object map, and the `destroy`
  the client is about to send for the vanished global returns as
  `invalid object` -- a fatal protocol error that takes the whole connection
  with it. Detached resources no-op every request and are reclaimed by the
  client's own destroy. On the client side the mirror rule is that
  `global_remove` must release the proxies locally (`wl_proxy_destroy`) and must
  not marshal requests against the removed global. Every
  `SurfaceShape` re-attaches off the next `global` event, so a toggle costs one
  round trip and no explicit re-registration.

## JSONL contract

Requests and responses are UTF-8 JSON objects separated by `\n`:

```json
{"version":1,"requestId":"uuid","operation":"audio.get","payload":{}}
{"version":1,"requestId":"uuid","ok":true,"result":{"available":true}}
```

Failures use stable codes and never include passwords or raw command output:

```json
{"version":1,"requestId":"uuid","ok":false,
 "error":{"code":"permission-denied","message":"无法修改亮度","retryable":true}}
```

Events are independent messages (`window.snapshot`, `thumbnail`,
`desktop.changed`, and so on) and do not carry a request ID. The complete
operation list and examples live in
[`shared/contracts/platform.v1.md`](../shared/contracts/platform.v1.md).

## Security and lifecycle

- Both sockets are created under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` with mode `0600`.
- Operations are explicit allow-listed names; clients cannot provide a shell
  command. Paths must be absolute, canonicalized (including existing symlinks),
  and validated against an existing parent directory before use.
- Wi-Fi credentials are passed in typed NetworkManager D-Bus settings and are
  not logged or persisted by QML; NetworkManager owns saved profile credentials.
- Destructive session operations are explicit (`session.reboot`,
  `session.poweroff`, etc.) and are not run by automated tests.
- QML clients keep one connection, queue writes while a service restarts, and
  match every response by `requestId`.
- `kos-data-service` owns durable state and history; `kos-platform` owns live
  desktop integration. Neither process embeds the other.

## Adapter ownership

| Module | Operations | Implementation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `applications` | launch installed desktop entries with optional URLs | KDE `KService` + `KIO::ApplicationLauncherJob`; desktop-entry parsing, activation and process grouping remain KDE-owned |
| `clipboard` | `clipboard.set/read/save-image`, history watch/list/copy/delete/clear | Qt `QClipboard`, Wayland MIME ownership, platform-supervised cliphist |
| `files` | open, copy, launch, transfer, trash, Trash state/empty, Open-With | Qt file APIs, KDE application launch jobs and `gio` for file operations |
| `kwin` | snapshots, activation, desktops, thumbnails, Dock animation tickets | KWin script + internal D-Bus |
| `network` | refresh, scan, connect, 802.1X, radio, traffic counters | NetworkManager/sysfs adapter |
| `audio` | get volume, set volume/mute | PipeWire/WirePlumber adapter |
| `bluetooth` | power, list, connect/disconnect | BlueZ adapter |
| `display` | per-display brightness get/set | KDE ScreenBrightness (including DDC/CI) / brightnessctl / sysfs fallback |
| `session` | lock, suspend, hibernate, logout, power | logind/systemd adapter |
| `theme` | toggle/reconfigure, glass and Dock-animation sync | KDE config and KWin reconfigure |
| `screenshot` | interactive capture | first available supported utility |
| `shortcuts` | install/uninstall, conflict checks, live registration | atomic `kglobalshortcutsrc` + desktop entries |

## Failure and recovery

An unavailable optional adapter returns `ok:false` with `retryable` set by the
adapter; the daemon remains alive and other operations continue. A service
restart removes and recreates only its own socket. Clients reconnect and
re-issue subscriptions (`kwin.subscribe`) after observing the connection
transition.
